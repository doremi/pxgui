PX-GUI v0.0.1
-------------

9.9.2003:
=========

Note:
Originaly developed on Windows 2000 using MinGW32 and Dev-C++ IDE. There is no configure or Makefile for linux. It's all up to you, ppl. Im just silly wind0ze programmer trying to get myself outside the M$ paradigm... Anyway, this project resides in my head right now - what's done is done from scratch. It's my first GUI project and Im inventing everything from ground-up without any help or reading about GUI systems. I think that that's the right sole to make something completely new :)


Requirements:
SDL 1.2.6 (www.libsdl.org)
C++ compiler


What's inside:
- basic button (no click handlers yet, only redraw on mouse click)
- basic draggable window with z-ordering and alpha blending (no font support yet) 
- mouse focusing


ToDo:
- everything ;)
